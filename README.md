Title: Arrays

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.
Indexing of an array starts from 0. It means the first element is stored at the 0th index, the second at 1st, and so on.
Elements of an array can be accessed using their indices.
Once an array is declared its size remains constant throughout the program.
An array can have multiple dimensions.Array with multiple dimensions is also known as matrix.
The number of elements in an array can be determined using the sizeof operator.
Array Declaration: data_type array_name[Size_of_array];
EXAMPLE:
int arr[5];
Here,

int: It is the type of data to be stored in the array. We can also use other data types such as char, float, and double.
arr: It is the name of the array.
5: It is the size of the array which means only 5 elements can be stored in the array.

Algorithm:

Start => declare an array of int type => enter 10 elements in the array => print the array as it is => take input from user and find that number in the array => then find the smallest and the greates number in the array =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:
We declare an array. Add elements to that array. Then print he array. Then take input from user and find that number in the array, and print whether it is present in the array or not. Then usin two for loops. One for loop finds the smallest number in the array and the second for loop finds the largest number in the array.
